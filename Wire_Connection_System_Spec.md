## 6. Data Processing Rules

### 6.1 Wire Path Calculation Algorithm

**Path Generation Logic (DP-001)**

```cpp
void Wire::calculatePath(const Vec2& fromPos, const Vec2& toPos) {
    pathPoints.clear();
    pathPoints.push_back(fromPos);
    
    // Direct connection for aligned ports
    if (fromPos.x == toPos.x || fromPos.y == toPos.y) {
        pathPoints.push_back(toPos);
        return;
    }
    
    // L-shaped path for diagonal connections
    // Rule: Horizontal first, then vertical
    Vec2 cornerPoint{toPos.x, fromPos.y};
    pathPoints.push_back(cornerPoint);
    pathPoints.push_back(toPos);
}
```

**Path Optimization Rules (DP-002)**
- Minimize total path length while avoiding gate overlaps (visual only)
- Prefer axis-aligned segments over diagonal segments
- Snap intermediate points to grid intersections
- Cache calculated paths until endpoints change

### 6.2 Connection Validation Logic

**Port Compatibility Matrix (DP-003)**

```cpp
bool isConnectionValid(const Gate& sourceGate, PortIndex sourcePort, 
                      const Gate& targetGate, PortIndex targetPort) {
    // Rule 1: Source must be output port
    if (sourcePort != Constants::OUTPUT_PORT) return false;
    
    // Rule 2: Target must be valid input port
    if (targetPort < 0 || targetPort >= Constants::MAX_INPUT_PORTS) return false;
    
    // Rule 3: Cannot connect gate to itself
    if (sourceGate.id == targetGate.id) return false;
    
    // Rule 4: Target port must be available
    if (targetGate.inputWires[targetPort] != Constants::INVALID_WIRE_ID) return false;
    
    // Rule 5: Source port must be available
    if (sourceGate.outputWire != Constants::INVALID_WIRE_ID) return false;
    
    return true;
}
```

**Circular Dependency Detection (DP-004)**
- Use depth-first search to detect cycles in connection graph
- Maximum search depth: 1000 levels (prevents infinite loops)
- Cache results for performance optimization
- Re-validate only when circuit topology changes

### 6.3 Signal Propagation Rules

**Signal Update Sequence (DP-005)**
1. **Input Collection**: Gather all input signals for each gate
2. **Logic Evaluation**: Calculate new output values using NOT operation
3. **Delay Processing**: Apply 0.1-second delay for changed outputs
4. **Signal Propagation**: Update wire signal states from gate outputs
5. **Cascade Update**: Trigger dependent gate recalculations

**Signal State Transitions (DP-006)**

| Input State | NOT Gate Output | Delay Applied |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| LOW → HIGH | HIGH → LOW | 0.1s |
| HIGH → LOW | LOW → HIGH | 0.1s |
| LOW → LOW | HIGH (stable) | No delay |
| HIGH → HIGH | LOW (stable) | No delay |
| UNDEFINED → Any | UNDEFINED | No delay |

- **Rendering System**: OpenGL/SDL2 graphics pipeline
- **Input System**: Mouse and keyboard event handling
- **Memory Management**: Object pools and cache-aligned structures

### 12.2 Implementation Dependencies
- **Step 1-4**: Foundation systems must be completed first
- **Step 5**: Gate placement system provides wire connection targets
- **Future Steps**: Signal simulation (Step 7) will use wire connections

### 12.3 External Dependencies
- **ImGui**: For wire property panels and debug interfaces
- **GLM**: For mathematical operations and vector calculations
- **Performance Profiling Tools**: For optimization validation
